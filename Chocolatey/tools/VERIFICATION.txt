VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
The origin of the embedded plugin can be downloaded from releases
on https://github.com/sirAndros/KeePassWinHello/releases/
and than can be verified by doing the following:

1. Fetch .plgx asset of the corresponding version from
   https://github.com/sirAndros/KeePassWinHello/releases/

2. Compute checksum using one of the following methods:
   - Call powershell function 'Get-FileHash'
   - Use chocolatey utility 'checksum'

3. The checksum must match the following:

   checksum: 4ECEDDC943F72AB5DF39EEBFE507BCB7B93DA49438A3E427667FE85BBA0571E6
   checksum type: SHA256

Likewise, the plugin installed from this package is identical and so must
match the checksum either. You can just install the package and than verify
.plgx file in KeePass Plugins folder.
